# Plant-Leaf-Recognition-using-CNN (Python-Flask and Tkinter)
Recognition of leaves of plant using Convolution Neural Network.
This Project can be deplyed on cloud servers such as using AWS, Google Cloud,etc and also the stand-alone application using python-tkinter.

The traditional method of classification of leaves or any of the agricultural or environmental
sophistication is widely dependent on human scope and intelligence. Most basic sense of
classification is vision which refer to eyes, however the error rate is more prominent since the
vision has a limited capability to classify and the classification is restricted to the knowledge
of the brain. Moreover, the variety of leaves found even in the smallest vicinity cannot be
classified near accurate due to the large variety of species present. Not only the variety in
species are a crucial factor influencing the classification there are more parameters on which
the classification is relying.

Similarity in the structures, pigments and other parameters that affects the classification and
hence further hamper the results. This results in the development of a faulty system. To avoid
the inconsistency in the system the machine learning principles and methods are used. More
precise methods are used to classify the leaves into the category or species they belong to.
Machine learning minimizes the error rate and helps us to diagnose multiple characteristics
and pattern which reduces human effort and emphasizes greatly on the accuracy factor, and in
turn learns with a greater learning rate as training is done appropriately and hence faster
classifications can be made. However, this system designing has a greater impact on the
traditionally implanted human approach. The model can be integrated with multiple other
better and further accurate models and used as a single coherent system.
